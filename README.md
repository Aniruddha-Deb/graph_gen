# graph_gen
An advanced program which is used for solving problems based on linear motion

The program first accepts 5 values: Initial velocity, final velocity, acceleration, time and distance. Unknown values are marked with a '?'. The program then computes the unknowns and outputs them onto the screen with a graph for the same. 

Built on Borland C++ compiler and TC IDE (Very old software, use only if you have the prerequisites, namely dosbox and tc ide)

**PERSONAL NOTE**: This software was written in 2015, when I was a very immature programmer without a lot of practice. By my (and many more people) standards, this code is Horrible, with a bunch of redundant functions and lot of useless statements which could have been done better using some algorithms and data structures.
